# S-MHBOS

## MHBOS visualization

The MHBOS visualization has been computed through the code inside create_animations.py by using the dataset shuttle from the ODDS Library (http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/). The images obtained from the execution can be observed in the folder outputs. Take into account that repeated values can make dynamic histograms have different frequencies inside each bin.

The dataset used was shuttle and should be placed in a folder named "datasets" for the execution.
